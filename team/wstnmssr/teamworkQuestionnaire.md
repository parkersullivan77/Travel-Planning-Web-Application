# Teamwork Questionnaire for Westin

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is easiest, and I will respond most frequently in the morning and afternoon/evening. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think my team will accomplish a polished end product to be proud of
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to gain experience in working alongside teammates with much different personalities than my own. Through this, I want to be able to communicate clearer in any case. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I believe my own work ethic and communication habits may inhibit me. I cannot always work when I need to, and I tend to make assumptions in my communication.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think the most likely case is disappointment of the "A" student, who will work alongside "B" work and be graded accordingly. However, I think it's possible for the "B" student to step up and out of their comfort to meet the "A" threshold.  
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Each member should do as equal an amount of work as they can. If a teammate chooses to work more and earn a better grade, it is not necessarily fair to the others who should do the same amount of work but ultimately will not.  
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I believe the perscribed 2-3 hours outside of class for each hour in class should suffice for success, but time in excess of this will indeed be necessary if 2-3 hours is not enough.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Each team member should work to their strengths while balancing equal workload. Proficiency should be the key factor. However, if there is a steep difference in contribution, then this should be overruled.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The entire team suffers from any one member's shortcomings. While they may suffer more severe consequences individually, no one is without loss. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Compromises must be made because agreement on the final product will make it much easier to produce.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will choose to adapt and expect the same of my teammates to come to some agreement. If our differences are drastic, then I will motivate myself with the consequences of incomplete work to make changes. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, this sort of organization is very beneficial.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * The team should meet at least 3-4 times a week to regularly converge on the state of the project.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Such agreement is ideal, but I think trust will be necessary to proceed without universal approval. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Determine the differences in reasoning and examine what is likely to be better for the final product. If it's impossible to get everyone onboard after much discussion, I think majority should rule. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * In such a case, straightforwardly address this issue and revise the team dynamic to ensure each memeber has something of an equal part in the process.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will admit this concern and suggest a refreshed delegation of responsibilities.
