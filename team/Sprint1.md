# Sprint #1 - t19 - We Them Boys

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: Westin Musser

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint#.md).

## Policies

* Someone else approves and merges commits, you may not merge your own changes.
* No commits to master
* No one completes and entire epic alone

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#30 TripCo: The application should identify the client and server currently in use*
* *#29 TripCo: Use a standard logging system on the server*
* *#28 User: I'd like to know who to thank for this tool*
* *#34 User: I want to compute the distance between two locations on the planet*
* *#35 User: I want to know where I am on the map*
* *#31 User: I may need distances in other units of measure*


## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#30 Client and Server identification*: This epic was straightforward for us. It did not present many problems.
* *#29 Standard Loggin*: Once our team determined what information should logged, this segment was a simple matter.
* *#28 About Page*: One of our team members had prior knowledge that he was able to give to everyone else and make this epic a matter of coalescing. We edited the same file together, which was the most difficult portion.
* *#34 Distance Calculator*: Some confusion about the specifics of this epic caused lag in completion. Once we got some clarity, the implementations were not very problematic.

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#35 User location*: We ran out of time
* *#31 New units of measurement*: We did not have time

#### What went well
* Out group has a good chemistry and can collaborate, communicate well
* Everyone was able to configure their environments in ama manner that did not inhibit team progress

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* The toString methods gave us lots of comfusion, and Parker spoke with Dave and cleared things up. 
* Westin struggled to use version control with Git. He took out time to reread the guides and seek out more instructional material. 

## Retrospective

#### What went well
We picked up the project quickly and were able to start making progress with only a small handful of interruptions. The team came together well and together produces a condusive work environment. 

#### Potential improvements
Our meeting times are not always the most ideal for optimal productivity. Additionally, the space we choose is not always accessible. We did not stick to who commited branches, even though the asignees worked on them. 

#### What we will change next time
Meeting times will be reconfigured to combine both opportune times and workable spaces, ensuring team meeting time is as productive as possible. Moreover, we will follow proper procedure closer.
