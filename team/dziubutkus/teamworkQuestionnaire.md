1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * The easiest way to reach me is by text. I am also always online on Slack. I am usually the most busy in the morning until 11am.

   * I expect that we will make a project that is above average, something that would challenge all of us.

   * My goal is to learn how to work efficiently when everybody has different schedules and different skillsets.

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * There can be a miscommunication on how the code should work. Students "B" should challenge themselves and try their best to get to "A".
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Everyone should have a similar amount of work. Student who wants to do more could try to help others more to complete their tasks.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * It depends on everybody's skillset. We should focus on our strengths, if the task is not someone's strength then the remaining team members will help/guide that person to successfully finish the task.

   * Someone missing a deadline will affect the overall team's progress.

   * We have to discuss what we want to accomplish before we start working on the project so that this question never comes up and everyone is on the same page.

   * Yes, I want to meet a few times per week to catch up on the progress, discuss new ideas.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think at least 3-4 times per week would be beneficial for the team.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think I would need approval of every team member when the decisions will affect the project and their work. There will be some changes that aren't significant and could be made individually. I think trusting each other will be very important.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will have to listen to that one member, discuss their ideas and try to make a compromise.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
