# Sprint 5 - T19 - We Them Boys

## Goal

### A Beautiful User Experience!
### Sprint Leader: Westin Musser

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment `server-5.0.jar` deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT5 assignment.
* Sprint Review, Restrospective, and Metrics completed (team/sprint5.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 50%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* #296 User: Make the application easier to use
* #157 User: Make my trip shorter 
* #238 User: Let me plan trips world wide 
* #35 User: I want to know where I am on the map 

There are multiple epics from sprint 4,3 that are either incomplete or imperfect
relative to user experience included. In additon to completing all of these, our 
other goal is to delete duplicate code and develop more tests to bring code 
coverage up to par. 

Changes to our interface at this point will mostly be made for the sake of user 
experience. Moreover, changes to code, especially in the server, will be 
primarily made for the sake of cleanliness.
